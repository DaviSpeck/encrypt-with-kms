# Encrypting data with AWS KMS
This repository aims to make public a model code for encryption with KMS (AWS service) and MongoDB using the Golang language. The system that motivated the study of this structure is an API that exists to perform financial calculations.

### AWS KMS
Create and control keys used to encrypt or digitally sign your data
- Centrally manage keys and define policies across integrated services and applications from a single point;
- Encrypt data within your applications with the AWS Encryption SDK data encryption library;
- Perform signing operations using asymmetric key pairs to validate digital signatures;
- Securely generate hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs) that ensure message integrity and authenticity.

### Golang
Is useful for carrying out programming for scalable servers and large software systems. The Golang programming language was built to fill in the gaps of C++ and Java that Google came across while working with its servers and distributed systems.

### MongoDB
Is a document database used to build highly available and scalable internet applications. With its flexible schema approach, it's popular with development teams using agile methodologies.
